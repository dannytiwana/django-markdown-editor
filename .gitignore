The virtual environment was not created successfully because ensurepip is not
available.  On Debian/Ubuntu systems, you need to install the python3-venv
package using the following command.

    apt install python3.9-venv

You may need to use sudo with that command.  After installing the python3-venv
package, recreate your virtual environment.

Failing command: ['/home/kali/django-markdown-editor/venv/bin/python', '-Im', 'ensurepip', '--upgrade', '--default-pip']
